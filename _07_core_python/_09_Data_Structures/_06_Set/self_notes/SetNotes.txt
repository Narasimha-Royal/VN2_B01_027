Sets :

	Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
	Sets are written with curly brackets.
	A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed.



Set items are unordered :

	Items in a set do not have a defined order.
	Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.


Set items are unchanegeble :

	Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.


Set items do not allow duplicates :

	Sets cannot have two items with the same value.
