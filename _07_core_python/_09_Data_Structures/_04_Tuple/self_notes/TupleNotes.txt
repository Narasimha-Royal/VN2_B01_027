Difference Between List and Tuple in Python:  



S.NO.			LIST	                                          TUPLE

1	Lists are mutable	                          	 1. Tuples are immutable

2	Implication of iterations is Time-consuming	   	 2.The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster

3	The list is better for performing operations,  	  	 3.Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
    	such as insertion and deletion.

4	Lists consume more memory	                	 4.Tuple consume less memory as compared to the list

5	Lists have several built-in methods	           	 5.Tuple does not have many built-in methods.

6	The unexpected changes and errors are more    	   	 6.In tuple, it is hard to take place
    	likely to occur
